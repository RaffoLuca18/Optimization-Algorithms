Use an ILP to find a shortest baking schedule. Schedule, in this context, is a set of starting times $s_1, ..., s_n$ denoting when should each pastry be put into oven. Note: these times need not be integral. However, integral variables will be useful to enforce that the periods when two different kinds of pastries are in the oven do not overlap.\n",

We did not cover this in the class and I do not go into details of this here either. But the other meaning of Big-M is a method for switching someof the constraints on/off depending on the value of some binary variable.\n",

(e.g., because we are minimizing over $x$, or we know that no feasible solution can have $x > M$ for some other reasons). Then, we can write $x \\le 10 + Mz$: if $z$ is 0, this switches the constraint ON. If $z = 1$ this constraint evaluates to $x \\le 10 + M$ which, by choice of $M$ is satisfied by any reasonable solution to our LP and this effectively switches the costraint OFF. Usually, due to possible numerical issues, it is recommended to use $M$ as small as possible. You can check the following blog for more discussion of big-M: https://orinanobworld.blogspot.com/2011/07/perils-of-big-m.html.\n",

I leave to your creativity how to do it, but it should be clear what are the moments when oven needs to be open, what pastry goes out and what should be put in. There are many other things to visualize: expected arrivals of custommers and times when each pastry is ready, critical preparations (which pastry needs special care to be prepared on time, otherwise it would delay the whole schedule, etc). The main criterion for evaluation of this will be clarity and information it provides.\n",
