For each contract, the monarch demands two representatives to stand for the contract relationship (they can either be from the same party of the contract or one from each party). By the default approach, each company would send one representative, hence requiring a total of 69 representatives. However, the companies aim to determine a solution that reduces the overall number of representatives present.\n",
